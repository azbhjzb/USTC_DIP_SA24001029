## Implementation of Deep Learning-based DIP

This repository is TianYu Li's implementation of Assignment_02(deep learning-based DIP) of DIP.  

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To download datasets,run:

```bash
bash download_facades_dataset.sh
```

## Training

To train the model, run:

```train
python train.py
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).

## Pre-trained Models

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### [Facades Datatset]((https://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~tylecr1/facade/))

| Model name         | Training Loss  | Validation Loss |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model   |     0.1021         |      0.4122       |

>ðŸ“‹  Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.
